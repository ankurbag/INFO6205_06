## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We need following things for set up-

#### IDE & project configuration
```
Eclipse
```
```
Java
```

### Installing

We have 2 projects in the repository

```
1. API project - Java
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
